      "explanation": "After action verb 'ran', use adverb 'quickly', not adjective 'quick'. Adverbs describe how the action is performed."

      "error": "She is working hardly on the project.",
      "correct": "She is working hard on the project.",
      "explanation": "'Hard' is both adjective and adverb. 'Hardly' means 'almost not', while 'hard' means 'with effort'."

  "quick_facts": [
    "Many adverbs are formed by adding '-ly' to adjectives, but not all words ending in '-ly' are adverbs (lonely, friendly are adjectives).",
    "Some common adverbs don't end in '-ly': fast, hard, well, good, bad, early, late, far, near.",
    "Adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs: 'She ran very quickly.' (very modifies the adverb quickly).",
    "Adverbs of frequency usually appear in the middle of sentences before the main verb (except with 'to be').",
    "An adverb can completely change the meaning: 'I hardly know him' vs. 'I know him hard' - only the first makes sense.",
    "'Good' is always an adjective. 'Well' is an adverb (except for health context: 'I am well' - adjective).",
    "Positive frequency adverbs: always, usually, often, sometimes, occasionally. Negative: never, rarely, seldom.",
    "The placement of adverbs can change meaning: 'I only saw John' vs. 'I saw only John' vs. 'I saw John only'."
