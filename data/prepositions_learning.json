  "definition": "A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other parts of a sentence. It typically shows position, direction, time, or relationship. Prepositions always have an object (usually a noun or pronoun following them).",
  "importance": "Prepositions are essential for expressing location, direction, time, and relationships. Without prepositions, we couldn't specify WHERE something is, WHEN it happens, or HOW things relate to each other. They're small words with big impacts on meaning.",

      "explanation": "Certain adjectives take specific prepositions. 'Interested' takes 'in', not 'at'."
    },
    {
      "error": "I've been studying since five years.",
      "correct": "I've been studying for five years.",
      "explanation": "'For' measures duration. 'Since' marks the starting point. Use 'for' with time periods."

    {
      "error": "He is different of his brother.",
      "correct": "He is different from his brother.",
      "explanation": "'Different' requires 'from', not 'of'. This is a fixed collocation in English."

      "error": "I am waiting during the bus.",

    },
    {
      "error": "The book is on under the table.",
      "correct": "The book is under the table.",
      "explanation": "Don't use two prepositions together. Choose the correct one: 'under' shows it's below the table."
    },
    {
      "error": "I'll go to home.",
      "correct": "I'll go home. (Or: I'll go to my home.)",
      "explanation": "'Home' is an adverb when referring to your residence, so no preposition is needed. But 'to the home' works if it's not yours."

  "quick_facts": [
    "English has about 150-200 common prepositions, though the most frequent ones are only about 50.",
    "Prepositions are usually short words with multiple meanings: 'by' can mean 'near', 'through', 'through agency', or show time.",
    "Some prepositions are simple (in, on, at, to) while others are compound (because of, in addition to, instead of).",
    "Different languages use different prepositions - this is why L2 speakers often make mistakes. It's not logical, it's just convention.",
    "The same preposition can have different meanings: 'in' can mean 'inside' (in the box), 'within a time' (in two hours), or 'during' (in summer).",
    "Phrasal verbs use prepositions but can completely change meaning: 'look' vs. 'look at' vs. 'look for' vs. 'look after'.",
    "Most common prepositions: in, on, at, to, for, of, with, by, from, as.",
    "Prepositions are often followed by gerunds (verb+ing): 'interested in learning', 'before leaving', 'after arriving'."
