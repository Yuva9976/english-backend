## 1. Parts of Speech

These are the basic building blocks of English sentences.

### 📘 Verbs and Verb Tenses
**Action verbs** express what is happening (run, work, study, write).  
**State verbs** express a situation or feeling (be, have, know, like).

**Common Verb Tenses:**
- **Present Simple:** I work every day
- **Present Continuous:** I am working now
- **Past Simple:** I worked yesterday
- **Past Continuous:** I was working at 5pm
- **Present Perfect:** I have worked here for 5 years
- **Future Simple:** I will work tomorrow

### 📗 Nouns
Nouns represent **people** (teacher, John), **places** (city, London), and **things** (table, music).

**Types of Nouns:**

- **Proper Nouns:** London, Mary, Monday
- **Countable Nouns:** one apple, two apples
- **Uncountable Nouns:** water, rice, information

**Examples:**
- **The** book (specific)
- **A** book (any book)
- **This** pen (near me)
- **My** car (possession)

### 📰 Conjunctions
Conjunctions join parts of sentences (and, but, or, because, although).

**Examples:**
- I like tea **and** coffee
- She is tired **but** happy
