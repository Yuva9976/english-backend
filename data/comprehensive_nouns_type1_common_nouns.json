          "Common nouns are the most basic type of noun in English. They refer to general categories of people, places, objects, or ideas rather than specific, named individuals or locations. For example, the words 'dog', 'city', 'book', and 'happiness' are all common nouns because they don't name a specific dog, city, book, or instance of happiness. Every time you see a cat on the street, you can call it a cat—that's a common noun. If that cat had the name 'Whiskers', then Whiskers becomes a proper noun. Common nouns are fundamental to English grammar and understanding them is the first step toward mastering other noun categories.",
          "Common nouns can be either countable or uncountable. Countable common nouns can be counted individually (one apple, two apples, three apples), while uncountable common nouns cannot be counted individually and are typically used in singular form (water, furniture, information). This distinction becomes important when choosing between singular and plural forms, and when deciding whether to use articles like 'a' or 'an' before the noun. Understanding this distinction helps you use nouns correctly in sentences.",
          "In everyday English conversation and writing, common nouns appear far more frequently than proper nouns. They form the backbone of sentences and are essential for basic communication. Learning to identify and use common nouns correctly will significantly improve your ability to construct clear, grammatically correct sentences in English. Most vocabulary you'll learn as a beginner consists of common nouns because they represent the everyday objects, people, and concepts you encounter regularly."
